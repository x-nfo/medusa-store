All Komerce API requests are made through a centralized base URL. Depending on the environment you are working in (production or sandbox/testing), you should direct your requests to the appropriate endpoint.

This is the live environment where real delivery orders, shipping rate calculations, and plugin communications occur.

**Base URL:**

<https://api.collaborator.komerce.id/>

Use this URL when your integration is ready for production and has passed sandbox testing. All production requests must be authenticated with a valid production token.

The sandbox environment is designed for testing purposes. No real shipments are created, and you can experiment safely with all endpoints.

**Base URL:**

<https://api-sandbox.collaborator.komerce.id/>

This endpoint behaves identically to production but operates in a separate, isolated environment.

To switch environments, you only need to change the base URL in your requests:

- **Use the sandbox URL** during development or testing.
- **Use the production URL** when your app is live.

⚠️ Make sure to use the correct authentication APIKEY for each environment. Sandbox APIKEY won't work in production when you didn't have any approval access from our Administrator.

Here's a sample curl request to retrieve the list of available couriers in production:

curl --request GET \\

\--url <https://api.collaborator.komerce.id/>

\--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_PRODUCTION_KEY'

For sandbox testing, just replace the base URL:

curl --request GET \\

\--url <https://api-sandbox.collaborator.komerce.id/>

\--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_SANDBOX_KEY'

| **Name** | **Path** | **Method** | **Description** |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Search Destination | /tariff/api/v1/destination/ | GET | for Search origin or destination id |
| Calculate | /tariff/api/v1/calculate | GET | for Search estimated shipping cost by origin and destination |
| Store Order | /order/api/v1/orders/store | POST | for Submit an order's |
| Cancel Order | /order/api/v1/orders/cancel | PUT | for Cancel an order's |
| Detail Order | /order/api/v1/orders/detail | GET | for Getting more information about Submited order |
| History AWB | /order/api/v1/orders/history-airway-bill | GET | for Checking track AWB |
| Pickup Order | /order/api/v1/pickup/request | POST | for Request a order Pickup time |
| Label Order | /order/api/v1/orders/print-label | POST | for Getting an label order's |
| Webhook | /Used your webhook handler URL | PUT | for Getting automation respon's about the order's |

- Always test new features or workflows in the sandbox before going live.
- Maintain separate credentials for sandbox and production.
- Never use sandbox credentials or URLs in your production app.
- Monitor responses and logs to ensure you're hitting the correct environment.

With the correct base URL and environment, you're now ready to explore Komerce's API capabilities.

To use the Komship Delivery API, you must first retrieve your API key from the Collaborator dashboard. This API key is essential for authenticating your requests and accessing the services provided by the API.

Follow these steps to locate your API key:

- **Login** to your
- Navigate to the **Integration** menu
- Click on **Api Key**
- Unlock your Shipping Delivery APIKEY.

&nbsp;danger

⚠️ Keep your API key secure. Do not share it or expose it in public-facing code or repositories.

Komerce may offer multiple API keys for different services. Make sure to:

- Use the API key labeled **Shipping Delivery**.
- **Do not** use API keys intended for other services (e.g., RajaOngkir, Shipping Cost, etc.)

&nbsp;danger

Using the wrong API key will result in failed authentication or limited functionality.

Include your API key as a Middleware in the **HEADER** of each API request:

x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY

curl --request GET \\

\--url <https://api-sandbox.collaborator.komerce.id>

\--header 'x-api-key: YOUR_API_KEY'

This will return the list of available couriers for your delivery orders.

If your API key is compromised or you need to rotate it, you can regenerate a new one from the same **API Key** section in your Komerce dashboard.

The Search Destination Endpoint is designed to provide a fast and accurate way to find locations within the shipping system. This endpoint supports searching for various administrative levels, including:

- City
- Districts
- Sub-districts
- Postal Codes

By integrating this endpoint, users can easily retrieve precise location details without manually mapping regional hierarchies. This ensures greater flexibility and accuracy in defining both origin and destination areas.

✅ Comprehensive Location Search - Supports multi-level search from provinces to sub-districts.  
✅ Optimized for Efficiency - Fast response times without additional processing on the user's side.  
✅ Seamless Logistics Integration - Ensures accurate regional mapping for shipping cost calculations.  
✅ Error Minimization - Reduces inconsistencies caused by mismatched regional data structures.

The Search Destination Endpoint streamlines the process of finding and selecting locations within a shipping workflow. Instead of requiring users to manually filter through Province → City → District → Sub-district, the system automates the search and presents relevant location options based on input criteria.

1️⃣ Automatic Location Hierarchy Processing

- Users can input search queries using City, District, Sub-district, or Postal Code.
- The system automatically maps and retrieves related location data without additional configuration.

2️⃣ Precise & Reliable Data Retrieval

- The response includes region IDs corresponding to the searched origin or destination.
- Users receive a structured JSON response containing multiple location options to select from.

3️⃣ Seamless Transition to Cost Calculation

- Once a user selects a location, the region ID can be used in the Calculate Endpoint for shipping cost estimation.
- This workflow ensures smooth data transition from location selection to shipping fee calculation.

The Search Destination Endpoint returns a JSON object containing:

- Region ID - Unique identifier for the location.
- Location Name - Full name of the matched region.
- Hierarchy Details - Information on province, city, and sub-district levels.

Users must select one of the provided options to finalize their destination before proceeding to cost estimation. This step ensures that the most accurate location is used for logistics calculations.

By leveraging the Search Destination Endpoint, users can enhance their shipping processes with:

✔ Faster location searches  
✔ More accurate origin & destination mapping  
✔ Effortless integration with the shipping fee calculation system

This approach eliminates manual regional data mapping, improving efficiency and reducing errors in shipping operations.

&nbsp;note

💡 Important: Incorrect origin or destination IDs will lead to inaccurate shipping costs. Always ensure the data is correct before making a request.

Users often ask:

&nbsp;note

"How does the system handle decimal weights?"

The Calculate Endpoint supports decimal weight values, which should be formatted using a dot (.) as the decimal separator. To comply with courier service standards, the system automatically rounds weights as needed, preventing errors and ensuring smooth validation.

Once all required data is submitted:

- The system validates the origin, destination, pinpoint, and weight values.
- The API fetches real-time shipping cost data from multiple courier services in our systems.
- A JSON response is returned, detailing available shipping options, prices, and simulate our store_order services for your maximize information.

Ensure required parameters are present:

- shipper_destination_id & receiver_destination_id → this value you can get from Search_destination EndPoint when you searching the origin or destination address using District/SubDistrict/PostalCode. This value can helping you to get more information about Regular or Cargo Shipping.
- origin_pin_point & destination_pin_point → this value you can get from ThirdParty maps to ensure identic pinpoint for origin and destination address for using InstantDelivery like GoSend, etc.
- weight → the total weight of the items (in Calculate EndPoint this value using an grams).
- item_value → the total value of the items (in IDR currency), this value can helping you to understand when using store_order parameter and describe more value to using the service.

The Store Order Endpoint allows users to create an order that will be validated and processed by Komerce. This endpoint integrates data obtained from previous steps:

- Search Destination Endpoint → Provides origin & destination IDs.
- Calculate Endpoint → Provides shipping cost details, including courier information.

Once an order is created, the system automatically deducts the shipping fee from the user's dashboard balance (if using the Bank Transfer method). If the balance is insufficient, the order will not be processed, and an error response will be returned.

✅ Seamless Order Creation - Integrates with previous endpoints to streamline the process.  
✅ Automated Balance Deduction - Ensures smooth transactions for prepaid orders.  
✅ Strict Data Validation - Ensures correct phone number format & other required fields.  
✅ Supports Multiple Payment Methods - Including COD and Bank Transfer.

Users must provide the following details:

- Order Information → Order date, brand name, shipper & receiver details.
- Shipping Details → Courier name, service type, shipping cost.
- Payment Method → COD or Bank Transfer. Unfortunetly, we don't have invoicing method automaticly. But, you can use invoicing method if you contact our Business Development for request invoicing method.
- Product Details → Name, variant, weight, dimensions, quantity.

&nbsp;warning

- Phone numbers must start with 62 or 8 (e.g., 6281234567890, 81234567890), not start with 0 or +62.
- An insufficient balance will prevent order processing if your balance is less than the value of the shipping charges to be made.
- Ensure all required fields are formatted correctly to avoid errors.

Once an order is submitted:

- The system validates the order details, including phone numbers, shipping cost, and payment method.
- If using Bank Transfer, the shipping cost is deducted from the user's balance.
- If all data is valid, the order is sent to us for processing.
- The system returns a confirmation response, indicating the order has been successfully created.

- Use the correct endpoint and query structure.

When creating an order via the store_order endpoint, users have the option to include insurance coverage for their shipments. Insurance is used to protect the value of the shipped goods in case of damage or loss during transit.

The insurance_value is determined based on the total product price (total_product_price) in an order and the specific courier's insurance policy. Each courier has its own insurance calculation method, as shown in the table below:

| **Courier** | **Insurance Price** | **Information** |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **JNE** | (0.2% \* total_product_price) + Rp5.000 | Fixed admin fee of IDR 5.000 applies. |
| **SiCepat** | 0.3% \* grand_total | Insurance is only applicable if grand_total > IDR 500.000. |
| **IDExpress** | 0.2% \* total_product_price | No additional admin fees. |
| **SAP** | (0.3% \* total_product_price) + Rp2.000/AWB | Additional IDR 2.000 per Air Waybill (AWB). |
| **Ninja** | 0.25% \* total_product_price | If total_product_price <= IDR 1.000.000, insurance_value = IDR 2.500.  <br>If total_product_price > IDR 1.000.000, insurance_value = 0.25% x total_product_price. |
| **J&T** | 0.2% \* total_product_price | No additional admin fees. |
| **Lion** | 0.3% \* total_product_price | No additional admin fees. |
| **GoSend** | Rp1.000 for Silver Insurance,  <br>Rp2.000 for Gold Insurance,  <br>Rp5.000 for Platinum Insurance | No additional admin fees. |

Let's say a merchant ships an order using JNE, with:

- total_product_price = IDR 1.000.000
- shipping_cost = IDR 25.000
- grand_total = IDR 1.025.000

Using JNE formulas :

(0.2\\% x 1000000) + 5000 = 2000 + 5000 = IDR 7000

So, the insurance cost insurance_value = IDR 7.000.

Insurance costs directly affect the merchant's net profit. The formula for net profit is:

net_profit = cod_value - (shipping_cost - shipping_cashback) - service_fee - insurance_value

If the merchant wants to pass the insurance cost to the buyer, they should add the same amount as insurance_value to additional_cost when creating the order.

&nbsp;warning

- Minimum of insurance_value : The minimum order value eligible for insurance is IDR 300,000.
- Accuracy of Calculation: Ensure that total_product_price and grand_total are correctly inputted to avoid discrepancies in insurance cost.
- Mandatory for High-Value Shipments: Some couriers require insurance for orders exceeding a certain value threshold (e.g., SiCepat for grand_total > IDR 500,000).

By properly including insurance in your orders, you ensure that your shipments are protected while maintaining a clear and accurate cost structure. 🚀

✅ Courier Management → Standardize label formats for efficient logistics.

By using the Label Printing Endpoint, businesses can streamline their order processing, reduce manual errors, and improve shipping efficiency. 🚀

Once an order is created and the pickup is successfully scheduled, the next critical step is to generate a shipping label - a document used by logistics partners to track, transport, and deliver the package. This is done through the POST /label-order endpoint.

From a business perspective, here's how the process flows:

- Order Confirmation: A customer places an order through your platform. This order is recorded in the system using the store-order API.
- Pickup Scheduled: Once the order is confirmed, your system schedules a pickup with the selected logistics provider using the pickup-order endpoint. This ensures the courier knows when and where to collect the package.
- Label Generation: After the pickup is scheduled, the label-order endpoint is called to generate the shipping label. This label includes the AWB (Air Waybill) number and essential delivery details. It serves as a ticket for the courier to recognize and deliver the parcel.
- Download & Attach: The label is returned in PDF format and should be downloaded and printed. The merchant or warehouse team then attaches this label to the package before handing it over to the courier.
- Package Ready for Delivery: Once labeled, the package is fully ready for pickup and delivery, ensuring a smooth handoff to logistics and end-to-end traceability.

- Ensures traceability with valid AWB numbers.
- Reduces manual errors during order processing.
- Improves delivery reliability by aligning with logistics partner requirements.
- Keeps your operations scalable and automated.

- Ensure Pickup is Scheduled: Before generating a label, confirm that the pickup has been successfully scheduled using the POST /pickup-order endpoint.
- Use a Valid order_no: Verify that the order_no provided exists and corresponds to an order that has completed the pickup scheduling process.
- Avoid Duplicate Label Requests: Once a label has been generated for an order, refrain from making additional label generation requests for the same order to prevent duplication errors.
- Check Order Status: Labels can only be generated for orders that are in the appropriate status (e.g., "Pickup Scheduled"). Attempting to generate a label for an order in an incorrect status will result in an error.
- Validate API Token: Ensure that your API token is valid and has the necessary permissions to perform label generation operations.
- Handle Errors Gracefully: Implement error handling in your application to manage scenarios where label generation fails, such as displaying user-friendly messages or retrying the operation as appropriate.

The Cancel Order Endpoint is designed to allow users to cancel an order that has already been created but has not yet been shipped. This functionality provides greater flexibility in order management and ensures that users do not incur unnecessary costs for orders that are no longer needed.

This endpoint is particularly important for orders that use the Bank Transfer payment method. When an order is created with this payment method, the system automatically deducts the shipping cost from the user's dashboard balance. If the order is later canceled, the system will refund the previously deducted balance, ensuring a fair and transparent process.

By implementing this endpoint, users can manage their orders efficiently, preventing unnecessary shipments and maintaining full control over their transactions.

✅ Flexibility: Users can cancel orders that are no longer needed before they are shipped.  
✅ Automatic Refunds: If a Bank Transfer payment was used, the system will automatically return the deducted balance, reducing financial risk for the user.  
✅ Transparency: The cancellation process ensures that users have full visibility into their order and financial status.  
✅ Error Prevention: By canceling unnecessary orders early, users can avoid incorrect shipments and additional logistics costs.  
✅ User-Friendly Process: The cancellation request is processed instantly, providing a seamless experience for users.

- Not all orders can be canceled. To be eligible for cancellation, an order must meet the following conditions:
  - Order Status Requirement
  - The order must be in "Created" or "Packing" status.
  - Orders in "Shipped", "In Transit", or "Delivered" status cannot be canceled.
  - If an order is already in the shipping process, cancellation is no longer possible, as the order is already being handled by the logistics provider.
- Payment Method Considerations
  - Orders paid via Bank Transfer will have their shipping costs automatically deducted from the user's dashboard balance at the time of order creation.
  - If such an order is canceled, the system will automatically refund the deducted balance back to the user's account.
  - Orders paid using Cash on Delivery (COD) or other non-prepaid payment methods do not involve balance deductions, and therefore do not require a refund upon cancellation.
- Cancellation Timeframe
  - Users must request cancellation before the order is shipped. Once the package has been handed over to the courier, the order can no longer be canceled.
  - The system will immediately validate the cancellation request and process it accordingly.
- User Initiates Cancellation Request
  - The user sends a cancellation request via the Cancel Order Endpoint, including the order ID and relevant details.
  - The system checks the current status of the order to determine if it is eligible for cancellation.
- System Validation
  - The system verifies whether the order is in "Created" or "Packing" status.
  - If the order is in a valid status, the system approves the cancellation request.
  - If the order has already been shipped or has an invalid status, the request is rejected, and an error message is returned.
- Automatic Refund for Bank Transfer Payments
  - If the order was paid using Bank Transfer, the system automatically refunds the deducted balance to the user's dashboard.
  - This ensures that the user does not lose funds on canceled orders.
- Order Status Update
  - Once successfully canceled, the order status is updated to "Canceled", preventing further processing or shipping.
  - The cancellation is recorded in the system for future reference.
- The buyer changes their mind : If the customer decides not to proceed with the order before it is shipped, the seller can cancel it immediately.
- Incorrect order details : If the order contains incorrect shipping information, product details, or pricing errors, the user can cancel the order and create a new one with the correct details.
- Out-of-stock products : If the seller realizes that a product is unavailable, they can cancel the order before processing it further.
- Payment-related issues : If there was an issue with payment (e.g., insufficient balance or failed transaction), the order can be canceled to prevent further complications.
- Accidental order creation : In cases where an order was placed by mistake, the cancellation feature allows users to correct the situation without unnecessary costs.

- Use a valid AWB number generated from a successful POST /label-order call. Invalid or mistyped numbers will return no data or an error.
- Wait for pickup confirmation before making tracking requests. If the package hasn't been scanned by the courier yet, the tracking history may be empty.
- Not all couriers support real-time tracking or may have delays in updating status. Implement fallback logic for cases where tracking data is temporarily unavailable.
- Handle empty or null results gracefully in UI displays and inform users that tracking may not be available yet.
- Implement rate-limiting and caching for high-frequency tracking requests to avoid performance bottlenecks or overuse of courier resources.
- Avoid exposing query parameter AWB numbers on the client-side if your application needs privacy or added security for tracking details.

Endpoint allows you to register or update your application's webhook URL for receiving real-time notifications from Komerce. Once set up, this webhook becomes a critical channel through which your system is informed of key order events, such as order status changes, pickup updates, delivery confirmations, cancellations, and more.

By using this endpoint, businesses no longer need to constantly poll the API for updates. Instead, Komerce will automatically push the latest data to your specified endpoint URL whenever an event occurs. This leads to faster system reactions, better resource efficiency, and a seamless user experience across your platform.

✅ Real-Time Event Notification : Automatically receive updates on order status changes without needing to query the API manually.  
✅ Flexible URL Management : Easily update the destination URL at any time by sending a new webhook URL to this endpoint.

curl --location --request PUT 'your_webhook_handler_url' \\

\--header 'accept: application/json' \\

\--header 'Content-Type: application/json' \\

\--data '{

"order_no": "{{ order.no }}",

"cnote": "{{ awb.no }}",

"status": "{{ status }}"

✅ Use a valid, HTTPS-secured URL to ensure safe and trusted communication between Komerce and your system.  
⚠️ Make sure your server can handle incoming POST requests and is always online to receive webhook notifications.  
🛑 Always return a 200 OK HTTP response to signal successful receipt. Failure to do so may lead to retries or webhook deactivation.  
🔐 Validate the incoming data to ensure the request is indeed from Komerce (you may implement signature validation for added security if supported).  
🧪 Test your webhook handler before going live to verify that it processes the payload correctly and handles edge cases like empty or malformed data.  
🔁 Avoid circular API calls that could be triggered by the webhook payload itself to prevent infinite loops in your system.  
💾 Log all webhook events for auditing and debugging purposes, especially when errors occur.
